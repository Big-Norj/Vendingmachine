# Vendingmachine


I created a smart contract using Solidity 

A basic vending machine that dispenses an item when a certain amount of funds has been deposited by the buyer, it also allows the owner of the vending machine to restock more items.

In this smart contract, I worked with address types, units and mappings, deployed and test the contract using the online Remix IDE.
